  # The internal telephone number is the VoIP account code,

  # The external telephone number is the number residing on

  # VoIP service provider.

  # In an outgoing call, the internal telephone number is the source of the call.
  # In an incoming call, the internal telephone number is the destination of the call.
  #
  # In an outgoing call, the external telephone number is the destination of the call.
  # In an incoming call, the external telephone number is the source of the call.
  #
  # Asterisell displays in CALL REPORT something like:
  #
  # > | INTERNAL VoIP Account | Call Direction | EXTERNAL Telephone Number |
  # > +-----------------------+----------------+---------------------------+
  # > | account123            |    outgoing    | 390423XXXX                |
  # > | account123            |    incoming    | 39343XXXXX                |
  #
  # so the distinction is between internal and external telephone number
  # and not between call source and destination.
  # The same distinction is done also in the rate forms.
  #
  # The problem is: what fields of the CDR record must Asterisell 
  # use for displaying in the call report the internal and external telephone number?
  #
  # Available options:
  # * 0: use "accountcode" field as internal telephone number (display in CALL REPORT the account-code name),
  #      use "dst/lastapp_accepted_values" field as external telephone number.
  # * 1: use "src" field as internal telephone number only for outgoing calls, 
  #      use "src" field as external telephone number only for incoming calls,
  #      use "dst/lastapp_accepted_values" as external telephone number only for outgoing calls,
  #      use "dst/lastapp_accepted_values" as internal telephone number only for incoming calls.
  #      in case of unprocessed/ignored/internal use always "src" field for internal calls.
  # * 2: use "src" field as internal telephone number,
  #      use "dst/lastapp_accepted_values" field as external telephone number.
  #      in case of unprocessed/ignored/internal use always "src" field for internal calls.
  # * 3: it is assigned from the CDRInitialProcessing rate, that must complete during initial processing of a rate,
  #      these fields:
  #        - `cdr.ar_asterisk_account_id` (null if it is missing, and RateProcess will inform the user of the error);
  #        - `cdr.cached_internal_telephone_number`;
  #        - `cdr.cached_external_telephone_number`;
  #        - `cdr.cached_masked_external_telephone_number`, can be null (it is completed from the framework), or with an explicit value
  #        - `cdr.ar_telephone_prefix.id` can be null (it is completed from the framework),
  #           or with an explicit value, in this case number portability is not automatically transferred to the telephone prefix,
  #           and it must be explicitely managed from the CDR processor;
  #      See `apps/asterisell/lib/rates/CustomCDRProcessing.php` for a template of associated processing rate.
  #      A rate like the proposed example must be added to the rate table.
  # * 4: use "accountcode" field as internal telephone number (display in CALL REPORT the account-code name),
  #      use "dst" as external telephone number for outgoing and internal calls,
  #      use "src" as external telephone number for incoming calls.
